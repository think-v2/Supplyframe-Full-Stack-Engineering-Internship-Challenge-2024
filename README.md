# Supplyframe Full Stack Engineering Internship Challenge 2024
 
 This project was created on a Windows 10/11 x64 machine. It may not function as intended if run on a machine that does not match this description.

 This project uses Liquipedia's information about Valorant teams to sort them and display each player and their description. Some teams may be missing if they have no current players or if Liquipedia has an internal error on their side when populating player content (which is extremely rare, and if it does happen, should only affect a few teams).

 ### Step 1 (Only needed once)
 Install ```Node.js```

 ### Step 2 (Only needed once)
 Execute ```update.bat```
 
 ### Step 3
 Execute ```run.bat```

 ### Step 4
 open the listed localhost address in browser, likely ```localhost:3000```

 ### Step 5
 ```ctrl+c``` to close
 
 ### Step 6 (Optional)
 Execute ```jest.bat``` to jest test the function used to package players
 Note: Make sure to close ```run.bat``` before using this or it will not work
